# C Sharp Basics

## Goal
To showcase my understanding of C#.

## Background
The work completed here is based on learning outcomes from my Algonquin College course Web Programming II.

## Tools
I used Visual Studio Community 2022 to run my C# code.

## Learning Outcomes

### C#
I understand C# is a object oriented, type-safe high-level programming language. 

### Types of Variables

#### bool
A variable which represents boolean values.

#### double
A double-precision floating-point variable.

#### float
A floating-point type variable.

#### int
An integer type variable.

## Creating Classes

### Create Classes
Using the Solution Explorer, I created a class called Rectangle.

#### Create Attributes
Within the Rectangle class, I gave it two private attributes.

### Declare Setters and Getters
Afterwards, I declared setters and getters for the attributes as public methods.

### Add Public Methods
Next, I added public methods for rectangle calculations.

### Instantiate the Class
Using proper syntax I substantiated my newly created rectangle class as myRectangle.

### Specify Values
I specified the values for the length and width attributes.

### Calculate Using Methods
With the values set in the attributes, I used my calculation attributes.

### Print to Console
Lastly, I used the Console.WriteLine method to output the data to the standard output system.

### Running Programs
By running the program with the Console.WriteLine command, I could ensure that my calculations and code was working as intended.


## Creating a Constructor
In order to save time, we can create a special method to set up the attributes of and values for the class. Doing so will save time
because we don't have to set the attributes and values in separate steps.

In my case, I created several constructors depending on what values are passed in.
This allowed me to pass in the values directly into the parameter and avoid using the setWidth and setLength methods.
