# C Sharp Basics

## Goal
To showcase my understanding of C#.

## Background
The work completed here is based on learning outcomes from my Algonquin College course Web Programming II.

## Tools
I used Visual Studio Community 2022 to run my C# code.

## Learning Outcomes

### C#
I understand C# is a object oriented, type-safe high-level programming language. 

### Types of Variables

#### bool
A variable which represents boolean values.

#### double
A double-precision floating-point variable.

#### float
A floating-point type variable.

#### int
An integer type variable.

## Exercises

### Create Classes
Using the Solution Explorer, I created a class called Rectangle.

#### Create Attributes
Within the Rectangle class, I gave it two private attributes.

### Declare Setters and Getters
Afterwards, I declared setters and getters for the attributes as public methods.

### Add Public Methods
Next, I added public methods for rectangle calculations.

### Instantiate the Class
Using proper syntax I substantiated my newly created rectangle class as myRectangle.

### Specify Values
I specified the values for the length and width attributes.

### Calculate Using Methods
With the values set in the attributes, I used my calculation attributes.

### Print to Console
Lastly, I used the Console.WriteLine method to output the data to the standard output system.
This helped ensure that my calculations and code was working as intended.
